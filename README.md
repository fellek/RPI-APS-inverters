# RPI-APS-inverters
a software for a raspberry pi zero to read the production of aps inverters yc600 and qs1

This project is intended for reading APS Systems inverters. The program can pair and poll YC600 and QS1 inverters, up to 9 pieces. The read values are 
- displayed on a web page  
- sent via mosquitto in a Json format
- saved in a database for charts and statistics. 

The program has a lot of smart features. All settings can be done via the webinterface. It has a console that can be used for debugging and sending/receiving zigbee messages.

See it in action on youtube: under construction

In case someone wants to print the housing: under construction

## FEATURES:
- all inverter information such as temperature, etc available
- production per solar panel displayed
- Easy wifi config portal
- Easy add, delete and pair inverters
- There are 3 different json formats, a special one for domoticz
- a very smart console to send zigbee commands and debug
- charts of the production at multiple days are available

## INSTALLATION
Download the package and burn the image on an sd card.
<br>Boot up. Open the wifi settings on your computer/tablet/phone. 
After a while you will see an accesspoint **RadioAP**. Connect to it with the paswd 'rpiradio'.
<br>Now browse to http://192.168.4.1 and enter your wifi credentials as well as a userename/password
for the security of your webpages. Click save and wait for the reboot button to appear. Click it.

<br>Next the raspberry reboots and tries to connect to your wifi. This may take a while!
You can find your raspberry ip address by browsing to http://rpiecu.local.
Or open your router's webpage to see the connected devices to find the ip address.
Or use a wifi analizer tool on your phone/tablet.

## FACTORY RESET
Start by wiping all present inverterdata (Console). 

## SETTINGS
You should expand the filesystem, go to menu, log in with the provided credentials and go to '<menu><system><expand fs'>
<br>After the reboot, the filesystem makes use of the entire sdcard. <br>Check the timezone.
<br>In the menuitem 'settings' you have to enter the coordinates of your location. Now your system can determine
sunset and sunrise. Also enter the id nr for the zigbee coordinator, this must be a 12 character string, like D6B3011B9780<br>
<br><br>Enter an offset to sunrise and sunset were the polling should start. Usually at sunrise the inverter is not yet started, <br>
it may even restart a couple of times when the power is alternately below or above the threshold value. To rule this out<br>
you could set an offset of about 10 minutes.  

## START THE ZIGBEE SYSTEM
Check first the hardware, than go to "console" and try to start the zigbee coordinator. With the healthcheck you can see if this succeeded.
If success you can configure an inverter, go to the menu Ã­nverters and fill up / save the form.
Now you can try to pair this inverter.  
If success, this inverter will be polled automatically every 5 minutes. The data is displayed in the frontpage abd charts,
and is send via Mosquitto. At reboot all processed will be started automatically. 

## HARDWARE
It is nothing more than a Raspberry pi Zero and a prepared cc2530, cc2531 zigbee module. And a powersupply. 
The zigbeemodule should be flashed with a firmware that can be found here https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/4221.
